#1. The Local Library website.   
    Welcome to the MDN "Local Library" Django tutorial, in which we develop a website that might be used 
    to manage the catalog for a local library.  
#2. Creating a skeleton website  
    This article shows how you can create a "skeleton" website, which you can then populate with site-specific
    settings, paths, models, views, and templates (we discuss these in later articles).  
#3. Using models.  
    This article shows how to define models for the LocalLibrary website. It explains what a model is, 
    how it is declared, and some of the main field types. It also briefly shows a few of the main ways you can 
    access model data.  
#4. Django admin site.  
    We'll use the Django Admin site to add some "real" book data. First we'll show you how to register the models 
    with the admin site, then we'll show you how to login and create some data. At the end of the article we will 
    show some of the ways you can further improve the presentation of the Admin site.  
#5. Creating our home page  
    We're now ready to add the code that displays our first complete page â€” a home page for the LocalLibrary website.
    The home page will show the number of records we have for each model type and provide sidebar navigation links 
    to our other pages. Along the way we'll gain practical experience in writing basic URL maps and views, 
    getting records from the database, and using templates.  
#6. Generic list and detail views.  
    This tutorial extends our LocalLibrary website, adding list and detail pages for books and authors. 
    Here we'll learn about generic class-based views, and show how they can reduce the amount of code 
    you have to write for common use cases. We'll also go into URL handling in greater detail, 
    showing how to perform basic pattern matching.  
#7. Sessions framework.  
    This tutorial extends our LocalLibrary website, adding a session-based visit-counter to the home page. 
    This is a relatively simple example, but it does show how you can use the session framework to provide 
    persistent behavior for anonymous users in your own sites.
#8. User authentication and permissions.  
    In this tutorial, we'll show you how to allow users to log in to your site with their own accounts, 
    and how to control what they can do and see based on whether or not they are logged in and their permissions.
    As part of this demonstration, we'll extend the LocalLibrary website, adding login and logout pages, 
    and user- and staff-specific pages for viewing books that have been borrowed.
