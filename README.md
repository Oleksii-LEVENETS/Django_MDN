#1. The Local Library website. 
    Welcome to the MDN "Local Library" Django tutorial, in which we develop a website that might be used 
    to manage the catalog for a local library.
#2. Creating a skeleton website. 
    This article shows how you can create a "skeleton" website, which you can then populate with site-specific
    settings, paths, models, views, and templates (we discuss these in later articles).
#3. Using models.
    This article shows how to define models for the LocalLibrary website. It explains what a model is, 
    how it is declared, and some of the main field types. It also briefly shows a few of the main ways you can 
    access model data.
